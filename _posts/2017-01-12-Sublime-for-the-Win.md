# Sublime for the Win!

As some of you can see, this is my first post on this blog (_Yaay!_), and as such, I've decided to write about the very tool I'm using to write it with. 

I am creative or what? 

....

Don't answer that...

Anyway, back to the topic at hand: **Sublime Text**. I've been a big fan of sublime since I started using it back in 2014. Before that I was still writing my code in *Notepad++* (and I still tend to have a copy of it installed, for old times sake), but notepad didn't have the best support for plugins, in fact I was researching HOW to write a  plugin for it (and never finished it) when I stumbled upon Sublime. Been in love with it ever since, and wouldn't want it any other way.

The main reason for that would be the simple and amazing was you can _customize_ it to your needs. As in many cases, I could describe a whole bunch of plugins and themes here, to showcase this, but if you are interested in some of the possiblities go check out http//packagecontrol.io for a list of all the Sublime goodies out there.


Aside from Slack, I've used quite a few other editors out there, like (Atom)[https://atom.io/] and (Brackets)[http://brackets.io/]. While both of them have a very nice look, with a material design interface, and a whole bunch of goodies, nothing can really beat the support that Sublime enjoys when it comes to community size and simplicity of use. 

One or two keycombos, and, _BAM_, you have a new plugin or theme installed. Or perhaps a bunch of code snippets. Or maybe a color picker right inside the editor. Everything is there for the taking in under 5 minutes of installation. On the other hand, while brackets has a nice veriety it does tend to lag when it comes to plugin management, as does atom. Not to mention some very weird design choices when it comes to user interactivity, for example, Atom tens to have a 'Soft Wrap' feature which behaves as the usual Word Wrap, with the exeption that it only wraps if the lines have at least some white space in there to wripe around. While interesting at first, as a first time user, understanding things like these can be daunting.

So, let me wrap it up in one simple sentence, when it comes to having a nice simple code editor (especially for web development), one thing comes to mind:
